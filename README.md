# AI Battle

3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
4. Run: `npm start` or `yarn start`

Optional:

When you want to get your AI merged, just send out a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and I'll merge it. This way we'll be able to battle each other's AI's!

## Rules
